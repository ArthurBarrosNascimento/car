# Project Car Shop 🏎️

<p>In this project, an API with CRUD operations was developed using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for managing a vehicle dealership.

This project was proposed by the Trybe course during my backend developer training. I enjoyed working on this project a lot because it gave me an idea of what it would be like to develop a real product for this type of business.</p>
